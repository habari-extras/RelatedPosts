			<p>Related Posts outputs a list of posts that related to the current post based on its tags. The number of posts to list, and the header for the list of posts, are configurable.</p><p>Usage: Add <code>$theme->related_posts();</code> to the theme template in the location you want the list to appear.</p><p>Styling the list relies on 3 classes:<ul><li><em>related-post</em>. Use this to style the overall list.</li><li><em>related-post-even</em>. Use this to style even numbered list items.</li><li><em>related-post-odd</em>. Use this to style odd numbered list items.</li></ul></p><p>Related Posts comes with a template (located in the plugin directory) that is used to format the lists. If you wish to use a different format, copy the template to your theme directory and customize it there.</p>
